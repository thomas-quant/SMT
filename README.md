# SMT
Quick module to detect smt's, with a small tester module to verify functionality.

3 classes of smt used, microsmt, swing smt, and fvg smt

### Swing SMT
Most commonly used smt type, smt where one asset sweeps a swing high / low formed at a common time, and the other doesn't.

### Micro SMT
Local indicator, good for observing potential local reversals when paired with other levels

### FVG SMT
A SMT where price fills an FVG on one asset, and fails to on the other, thus balancing the pricerange on the sweeping asset.
